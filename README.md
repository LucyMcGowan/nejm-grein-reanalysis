This repo contains data extracted from Figure 2 from this paper https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007016

These were extracted (by hand) by me, so there may be mistakes.

Note: `end_rdv` the date the patient ends treatment is going to read in as a character value because patient 31 seems to end both on day 10 and day 13.
